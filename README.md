# 2D Traffic Simulation
This project is a simple 2D traffic simulation implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library. It simulates a basic traffic scenario where vehicles move on a road network and follow traffic lights.

### Prerequisites
Before running the simulation, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system(tested on Ubuntu 22.04):

- C++ compiler
- SDL2 library

The project utilizes the SDL2 library for graphics rendering. Visit the SDL website for more information on SDL2.


## Usage
To run the traffic simulation, execute make and make test in terminal.
